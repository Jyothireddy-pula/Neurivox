Neurivox  | OS

Your Browser. Now Powered by AI.

Neurivox  | OS is a simple idea turned into a powerful browser extension — bringing AI directly where you need it.
Instead of jumping between tabs to use ChatGPT or other tools, you can now run prompts right inside your browser with just a right-click.

🌐 What It Does

Highlight any text → Right-click → Choose an AI action.

Fix grammar, summarize content, rewrite text, translate — all instantly.

No switching tabs, no copy-pasting, no interruptions.

💡 Why I Built This

I was tired of repeating the same tasks with AI tools again and again.
So I decided to build my own solution — a lightweight, open-source extension that makes AI feel like a natural part of browsing.

This project started as an experiment and turned into something much more — a personal mission to make AI more accessible, faster, and effortless.
